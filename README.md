# Pandas-Data-Analysis
Using Pandas in Jupyter Notebook to analyse and present data to the user.

# How did the task go?

The code in this task merges the data provided and then analysing the reading and mathematic scores across districts, follwoing other criteria which is broken down in different ways inlcuding but not limited to school, school type, school budget and school size. 

# The data was then used to draw the following conclusions:

* The Charter and District schools demonstrated a increased performance evidenced by the increased maths score.
* Further analysis of the charter school and there departments would be usedful to see how larger schools could improve.


# Thoughts
As a whole I was pleased with the produced work, my challenges during this task arose when troubleshooting and trying to get the syntax right. I managed to overcome early problems by going back and analysing my code to reduce errors.
